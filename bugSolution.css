The solution involves using a more robust selector that's less susceptible to whitespace-only text nodes.  Instead of relying on `:first-of-type`, we can use a direct child selector combined with `:nth-child(1)`:

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container > p {
  color: red;
}

.container > p:nth-child(1) {
  color: blue;
}
```

This solution targets only the direct child paragraph elements of the `.container` and applies the blue color specifically to the first one.  This method avoids the issues caused by whitespace-only text nodes, making the behavior more consistent across different browsers.
